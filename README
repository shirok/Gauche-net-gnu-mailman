Add/remove subscribers to/from a mailing list managed by GNU Mailman.

This module directly accesses and scrapes Mailman's web interface,
so it may cease to work if their page design and/or form parameters
change.

I hacked up this code out of necessity several years ago, and it's
been working so far and it seems useful in general.


Usage:

 (use net.gnu.mailman)

 (define ml (make <mailman>
               :server "example.org"
               :admin-path "/admin"        ;; path to the admin cgi script
               :name "my-mailing-list"     ;; ML name
               :password "adminpassword")) ;; admin password

 (unless (mailman-login ml)
   (error "login failed"))

 ;; Add addresses to ML
 (mailman-subscribe ml '("foo@example.com" "bar@example.org" ...))

 ;; Remove addresses from ML
 (mailman-unsubscribe ml '("foo@example.com" "bar@example.org" ...))


Notes:

mailman-login, mailman-subscribe and mailman-unsubscribe all return #t
on success, #f on failure.  On failure, the status code and the body
of server response are recorded by the default log drain (see
gauche.logger).  On success, the addresses are logged.

It may be a good idea to raise an exception on failure, and
let the application handles the logging.
